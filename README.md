# YAPG
Very simple password generator. Generates any (practical) password size.
You can choose from:
* Uppercase letters
* Lowercase letters
* Numbers
* Special characters

### How to use

Just compile the `main.cpp` like so: `g++ main.cpp` and then just type `./a.out`.
If you've done everything right and fought your way through the program the output should look something like this:

```
$ ./a.out 
:: How long should your password be? [Default:10] 12
:: May contain lowercase letters? [Y/n] y
:: May contain uppercase letters? [Y/n] y
:: May contain numbers? [Y/n] y
:: May contain special characters? [Y/n] y
Finished! Your password is: B$Rgc~N43>@5
```
